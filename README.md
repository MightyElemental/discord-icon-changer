This bot needs the `Manage Server` permission to work.
Otherwise it can not set the icon.
Thanks to all the people behind https://github.com/Rapptz/discord.py for such an amazing library!

Upon joining or when starting the bot, it will generate folders to store the icons you wish to be used on the server.
The bot will then randomly select an icon for each server from the respective folder and change the servers' icons.


## geticon
?geticon

This will return a link to the current server icon.
